# Configuration transformer for the Sylius Grid Bundle
Converts a file to the new PHP Syntax.

## How to use:
* Clone the repository
* `composer install`
* `bin/config-converter <path>`

## Todo
* Check if the output even works.
* Check to see if there are options that are unhandled. (try to convert more grids)
* See if the output of the yaml and the php produces the same grid array after being parsed by Sylius
